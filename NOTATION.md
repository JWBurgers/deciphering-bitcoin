# Notation

## Key terms

Key terms are emphasized via boldface when they are first introduced and/or described. For instance, the term "bitcoind" would look as follows: **bitcoind**. All the key terms are captured in a glossary. 

Typically, the first introduction of the term would be accompanied by a further description. For exceptions, the term is emphasized both when it is introduced and when it is described. 


## Emphasized words and phrases

Words and phrases are emphasized via boldface and italics. For instance, the phrase "Remember your password" would look as follows: ***Remember your password***. 


## Instructions

Command-line instructions are formatted in bold and monospace, and preceded by "$". The instruction "sudo shutdown" would, for example, look as follows: **`$ sudo shutdown`**.


## Sample configuration files and code

Any sample configuration files and code are written out in monospace.


## System terms

In *Part IV*, we will set up a server. Any terms related to your server or managing computer system outputs are formatted in bold and monospace. These can include command names, configuration settings, directory and file names, account and group names, menu options, and so on. So the directory "btc-server", for instance, would be written as follows: **`btc-server`**.
