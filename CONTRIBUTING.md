If you have minor corrections or suggestions, you can create a pull request or raise an issue. Please mind the following guidelines with pull requests:

* Keep any pull request limited to suggestions for one document
* Include all your suggested changes through a single commit, unless you think there is good reason to use multiple commits
* Label any commits as "Revisions to [DOCUMENT_NAME]"
